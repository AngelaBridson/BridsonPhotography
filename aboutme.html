    <p>Hey! Welcome to my website! My name is Angela Bridson and I'm a budding photographer currently based in Cheshire.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My love for photography started from a very young age. My GGD (Great Grandad) was a lover of cameras himself, he would often be showing me his 
      collection, his array of photo albums or we would be looking out of his living room, through his binoculars and across the River Dee marshes for wildlife. He mostly 
      enjoyed taking pictures of flowers and birds, but he was also your go-to camera guy on holiday. I didn't follow in his footsteps much with the flowers and birds,
      but the portraiture, that's what really got me excited about picking up the camera. I'm not much of a fan of 'pose for the camera' shots, I haven't had much practice with that yet. I've found I've really enjoyed taking 
      photos of people talking, laughing, getting lost in thought. Capturing the moment. </p>

    <p>My photography experince startd in highschool. It came up on the curriculum as an after school GCSE. I found it quite limiting and didn't have as much
      involved in it as I initially thought. Once I had finished my GCSE's I decided to take an Art and Design Level 3 course at collage. I was interested 
      in tattoo's and the prospect of applying for an apprenticeship in the future so that course seemed the best for both interests. Life then got in the way,
      i came away with the qualification after the two years and ended up working as a barmaid. 
      about 12-18 months ago I decided to pick up the camera again, I updated my kit, swapping out my Canon powershot for a Nikon D3400 and enrolled on an online
      photography course with IOP (Institute-of-Photography). Since then I have taken a few shots on holiday's, with friends and I also photographed my Best friends wedding day. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>When I'm not taking photos I'm often reading, listening to music/attending live gigs or gaming/streaming on twitch. I'm a very social person and through corona virus I have started
      gaming more to keep up that social interaction and I'm really enjoying it.  </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Before covid struck, I was getting some things lined up to do a few cosplay/fantasy shoot, to have a practice with that style and using models. 
      Unforunately that wasn't able to go ahead but will be something to come in the future! 
      My next series will be a few shoots with some dogs. I know a dog walker/behaviourilist that is willing to give me experience whilst he's doing classes and walks.</p>
    <p></p>
